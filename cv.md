### Software Engineering

I believe that software engineering is as much of an art and a craft as it is a science. I
believe that engineers should care about usability, and that encompasses the whole of
the human computer interface from direct user experience to API design. Iâ€™m passionate
in my belief that testing must be part of engineering if we are to really care about
quality. I believe, and my experience has been, that we can ensure quality in what we
produce through good practises and processes, whilst understanding that there are
always trade-offs involved. Quality means systems that work, that are stable and that
can be easily maintained and extended.

I'm available for training, coaching, mentoring and consulting work in the UK and Europe.
