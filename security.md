---

Security breaches can devastate organisations, compromise user data, and destroy trust. As web applications become increasingly central to business operations, secure development practices are not optional â€“ they're essential. This intensive two day courses equips Python developers with both the theoretical understanding and practical skills needed to build secure web applications. From cryptographic fundamentals to real-world implementation patterns, you'll learn how to identify vulnerabilities and implement robust security measures at every layer of your application with a Defence in Depth approach.

The course covers important security principles, and mitigating specific vulnerabilities including The OWASP Top Ten, but is focused on secure Python web application development.

This is a practical and hands on, two day, course. Learn how to use the security tools that come in the Python standard library. Modules covered include:

* hashlib
* hmac
* secrets
* random
* socket
* ssl

Web application frameworks:

* Security features in web application frameworks for API servers and web applications
* How to secure data in Django, Flask and other popular web application frameworks
* Secure deployment practises with containers and application servers (WSGI or ASGI)

Third party libraries for cryptography and secure network access:

* authlib
* cryptography
* httpx and requests
* websocket
* jwt
* OpenZiti for application level zero trust architecture
* certifi for TLS certification verification

Tooling for secure Python development and as part of your CI pipelines:

* uv/pipenv
* pip-audit
* bandit
* ruff
* mypy
* dependabot/renovate
* Security testing

Network security with TLS:

* How, why and when to use TLS
* How TLS works
* mTLS for enhanced security
* Generating self-signed certificates for local development, with the cryptography library

Michael Foord has been a Python application developer for over twenty years, is a Python core developer and the creator of unittest.mock, and is the author of "The Absolute Minimum Every Python Web Application Developer Must Know About Security".
