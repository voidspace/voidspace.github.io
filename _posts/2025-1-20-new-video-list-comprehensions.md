A new one hour Knowledge Share video is online on YouTube.

* [List Comprehensions, Generator Expressions & Function Signatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_SoOmUqKuk&t=360s)

This session is on working with data using enumerate, zip plus list comprehensions and generator expressions. Along the way we'll talk about tuple unpacking, set and dictionary comprehensions and even nested list comprehensions.

We finish off with a look at function signatures: required and optional arguments plus positional and keyword arguments and positional only and keyword only arguments.

You can see all the sessions, eight so far, on a range of Python topics from generators to the concurrency to testing with pytest on YouTube:
