The [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.net/) have published part one of an article of mine. The article is called "Essential Python Web Security" and it's part one of a series called "The Absolute Minimum Every Python Web Application Developer Must Know About Security". The subject is Full Stack Security for Python web applications, based on the Defence in Depth approach.

*This series explores the critical security principles every Python web developer should know. Whilst hard and fast rules, like avoiding plaintext passwords and custom security algorithms, are essential - a deeper understanding of broader security principles is equally important. This first pots delves into fundamental security best practises, ranging from general principles to specific Python-related techniques.*

Part 2, on Cryptographic Algorithms, will be published soon.
