My first blog post in a few years! I have some articles I'd like to publish, and some adventures to share, so I thought it was time to
fire up a blog engine again.

 My nine year old son, Benjamin, is really into programming with Scratch and he's keen to play with electronics and learn MicroPython. Which is awesome because there's almost nothing I would love to do more with him.

[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) is an extremely impressive implementation of Python that will run on embedded devices and microcontrollers, as well as bigger tiny computers like the Raspberry Pi.

 I've dug out an old [MicroBit](https://microbit.org/) I had, purchased a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html) board/kit and also a ZumoBot 2040 robot which uses the same microcontroller as the Pico, to play with.

I'm now starting to get to grips with the basics, using the [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/).

I have a bunch of Neopixel LEDs, including a long light strip, I'd like to wire up in my living room controlled by a Pico board and an Android App using Kivy. That's my goal number 1.

I'd like to program the ZumoBot to explore and map my flat. Goal 2.

Meanwhile Benjamin is enjoying playing with electronics (switches, LEDs, potentiometer and now a motor) with the Pico and on his own he's programming the MicroBit with Scratch (or at least "blocks" which is the Microsoft equivalent). I've also done my first soldering in over a decade.

I have a github repository to track my tinkering, but I'd like to write up some recipes and post them on this blog as I go.
(The biggest hurdle is I can't easily create circuit diagrams. Time to explore.)
