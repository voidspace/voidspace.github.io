For the last year I've been working as a team lead for backend API development with [Gigaclear](https://gigaclear.com/) a UK rural ISP who own and run fibre internet to rural communities across the UK. This is alongside my training work.

This image shows the main project I've been working on since joining Gigaclear, One Touch Switch. A regulatory requirement for all ISPs to allow automated switching between ISPs. When you sign up with a new internet provider your account is automatically ceased with the old provider and VOIP numbers can be automatically ported.

Our OTS project is just part of the Gigaclear One Touch Switch system which interfaces with Salesforce and Netadmin and the website order flow (the Online Buying Journey) and represents an impressive engineering effort. We were one of the first ISPs with a system ready to take part in industry trials a few months ago, both OTS and our underlying systems passed pen testing with flying colours, and the switch on has been smooth. 

Something I'm proud to have been part of. My current project is preparing security awareness training materials based on OWASP for our various engineering departments whilst we also undertake a systematic review of all of our systems and processes.

In the diagram I'm team lead for the Sphinx engineering team.
