I've been a fan of Agile ever since my first programming job with Resolver Systems back in 2006. I had taught myself programming and there I really learned engineering, how to build software products whilst caring about quality. I became passionate about testing as a way to ensure a minimal level of quality and about agile processes which are able to change quickly.

My only experience of Scrum was for a year at a heavily waterfall shop which layered Scrum for project management on top of heavily waterfall software development processes. It wasn't a fun experience but I still learned a great deal.

I've been working with Gigaclear, as team lead on backend API servers, including [One Touch Switch](/gigaclear-ots/), for about a year now. I enjoy our software development practises and processes; we use a combination of agile for software development, devops (devsecops of course) for software deployment and maintenance, and Scrum for project management. It's a very effective combination.

I recently attended a course with the [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilecentre.com/courses/scrum-master/certified-scrummaster/), led by [John McFadyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmcfadyen/), and became certified as a Scrummaster.

The course was fantastic and very inspiring. At Gigaclear we're systematically evaluating all our systems, systems architecture and processes. This process and the course have been hugely inspirational and I have an article on software development processes coming shortly...
