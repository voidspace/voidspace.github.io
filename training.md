Most of my training is now delivered remotely, via Zoom or Teams, but I'm available for onsite training.

My most popular courses are:

* [Advanced Python (3 days)](/advanced/)
* [Introduction to Python (3 days)](/introduction-python/)
* [Object Oriented Theory with Python (2 days)](/oopwithpython/)
* [Secure Python Web Application Development (2 days)](/security/)
* [Testing with pytest (1 day)](/testing-pytest/)

Bespoke courses, e.g. web scraping and SQL, are also available. [Contact me](mailto:michael@python.org)

Several one hour sessions, seven so far, on a range of Python topics from generators to the concurrency to testing with pytest are available on YouTube. :

* [Python Knowledge Share Videos on YouTube](/python-knowledge-share-videos/)
