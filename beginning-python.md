This is a three day course aimed to take technical non-programmers to the place where
they can write and understand simple scripts and programmers. Particularly useful as
an introduction for the language for new programmers or for those retraining for jobs
such as testers or scripters. It assumes no programming experience.

If you're interesting in this course, which can be delivered on-site or on our premises
and the contents can be tailored to your needs, please contact [Michael Foord](mailto:michael@python.org[])

It's a great introduction course for courses like [Practical Python](/practical-pthon/)
or [Web Testing with Python](/web-testing/).

Python is a very powerful language, capable of building full systems and applications
and used in image processing by film companies, data science by everyone and runs large
parts of the internet. It has the great advantage of being extremely easy to learn, even
being taught in school. You can use purely the scripting aspects of Python, along with
simple functions to achieve a great deal and for many people this is the substance of their
day job.

The aim of this course is to take people who don't know Python would like to be begin and
end up in a place where they can write practical scripts and tools and enable them to learn
further. Suitable for teachers, system-administrators, testers and anyone wanting to learn Python.

It's a fast paced course, with lots of lab exercises to ensure participants really learn what
is being taught. But the pace is adjusted to make sure everyone follows along.

The curriculum for this two day course is:

Day 1
=====

Starting Out: The Python Code Editor IDLE
-----------------------------------------

-   Getting started: does everyone have Python installed and can launch
    IDLE (or their preferred code editor)
-   Hello World! Creating and running your first Python program.
-   The command line. Running Python scripts from the command line.
-   The interactive interpreter, your best friend for experimenting with
    Python.
-   Resources: ensuring everyone has the course material and is able to
    find and use the exercises, example code and data.

What is Python
--------------

A brief introduction to Python, what it is used for and why you should
care.

The Basic Datatypes
-------------------

Along the way in this section we'll come across concepts like statements
and expressions, comments and block structure by indentation. All vital
concepts when programming with Python.

-----------------

-   The string data-type
-   The string data-type

-   Different kinds of quotes including multi-line strings
-   Escaping data in strings (with a note about string formatting,
    covered in more detail later)
-   Unicode, encodings (for sending, receiving and storing text) and
    fancy characters
-   String slicing and indexing
-   The len function and in operator
-   String methods
-   Asking for data from the user with the input function
-   Converting data to strings with str and repr

Basic Code Structure
--------------------

-   Loops

-   Dictionary operations and methods

The file Type
-------------

-   Reading text to and from a file
-   Bringing it together, a real world example of reading, processing
    and saving data with files and the basic data types

Functions
---------

Functions are the most basic element of code reuse and structure in
Python. Moving from scripts to programs.

Day 2
=====

Variables in Detail
-------------------
