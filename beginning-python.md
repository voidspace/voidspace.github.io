This is a two day course aimed to take technical non-programmers to the place where
they can write and understand simple scripts and programmers. Particularly useful as
an introduction for the language for new programmers or for those retraining for jobs
such as testers or scripters. It assumes no programming experience.

If you're interesting in this course, which can be delivered on-site or on our premises
and the contents can be tailored to your needs, please contact [Michael Foord](mailto:michael@python.org[])

It's a great introduction course for courses like [Practical Python](/practical-pthon/)
or [Web Testing with Python](/web-testing/).

Python is a very powerful language, capable of building full systems and applications
and used in image processing by film companies, data science by everyone and runs large
parts of the internet. It has the great advantage of being extremely easy to learn, even
being taught in school. You can use purely the scripting aspects of Python, along with
simple functions to achieve a great deal and for many people this is the substance of their
day job.

The aim of this course is to take people who don't know Python would like to be begin and
end up in a place where they can write practical scripts and tools and enable them to learn
further. Suitable for teachers, system-administrators, testers and anyone wanting to learn Python.

It's a fast paced course, with lots of lab exercises to ensure participants really learn what
is being taught. But the pace is adjusted to make sure everyone follows along.

The curriculum for this two day course is:

Day 1
=====

Starting Out: The Python Code Editor IDLE
-----------------------------------------

-   Getting started: does everyone have Python installed and can launch
    IDLE (or their preferred code editor)
-   Hello World! Creating and running your first Python program.
-   The command line. Running Python scripts from the command line.
-   The interactive interpreter, your best friend for experimenting with
    Python.
-   Resources: ensuring everyone has the course material and is able to
    find and use the exercises, example code and data.

What is Python
--------------

A brief introduction to Python, what it is used for and why you should
care.

The Basic Datatypes
-------------------

Along the way in this section we'll come across concepts like statements
and expressions, comments and block structure by indentation. All vital
concepts when programming with Python.

Working with Numbers
--------------------

-   Integers and floating point numbers
-   The dangers of floating point
-   Basic maths operations
-   The math module
-   Converting numbers
-   A note about other number types (decimals and fractions)

Working with Text
-----------------

-   The string data-type
-   The string data-type
-   The print function
-   Different kinds of quotes including multi-line strings
-   Escaping data in strings (with a note about string formatting,
    covered in more detail later)
-   Unicode, encodings (for sending, receiving and storing text) and
    fancy characters
-   String slicing and indexing
-   The len function and in operator
-   String methods
-   Asking for data from the user with the input function
-   Converting data to strings with str and repr

Basic Code Structure
--------------------

-   Loops
-   If/else blocks
-   A discussion of True and False
-   Comparisons
-   The while statement
-   The pass statement
-   Attributes and function calls

The Container Types
-------------------

The List
~~~~~~~~

-   Splitting strings into a list
-   Basic list operations
-   Iterating over a list
-   Searching a list
-   List methods
-   Sorting

Dictionaries
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   The dictionary type
-   When to use a dictionary rather than a list
-   Dictionary operations and methods

The file Type
-------------

-   Reading text to and from a file
-   Bringing it together, a real world example of reading, processing
    and saving data with files and the basic data types

Functions
---------

Functions are the most basic element of code reuse and structure in
Python. Moving from scripts to programs.

-   The def statements
-   Taking arguments
-   Returning values
-   Function scope, globals and local variables

Errors and Exception Handling
-----------------------------

-   What happens when things go wrong
-   What is an exception
-   Catching exceptions
-   Raising exceptions

Data Handling
=============

-   None
-   Tuples, how are they different from lists
-   Tuple packing and unpacking
-   Lists of tuples, real world data handling
-   Formatting output with string formatting, writing CSV files
-   Working with sequences (len, max, min, indexing and slicing)

Looping Revisited
-----------------

-   The for loop and iterables
-   The loop variables
-   The break statement
-   The continue statement
-   Using range to loop over numbers
-   Keeping a count with enumerate
-   Looping with tuples and multiple variables
-   List comprehensions, a handy shortcut

Day 2
=====

Variables in Detail
-------------------

-   What happens with assignment
-   It's a name not a variable
-   References, assignment never copies
-   Reassigning names
-   Identity and equality
-   Scope revisited

Types
-----

-   Everything has a type
-   Type converter functions
-   Checking the type
-   Everything is an object

Program Structure: Functions Revisited and Modules
--------------------------------------------------

-   Organising your functions
-   Default values and keyword arguments for functions
-   Multiple return values
-   Functions don't receive copies (mutable arguments)
-   Importing functions from modules
-   Module as namespace

Object Orientation
------------------

An introduction to the object oriented features of Python. Mostly to
understand Python objects and libraries rather than to write new
classes.

    secret of Python) (optional topic dependant on time)
